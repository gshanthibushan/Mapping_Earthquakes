# Mapping_Earthquakes
Learned to use JavaScript's Leaflet library along with the Mapbox API to create visualization of earthquake data from the U.S Geological Survey.

## Following were Learned and applied
  * Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
  * Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
  * Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
  * Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
  * Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
  * Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
  * Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
  * Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
  * Render maps on a local server.
